Hey Guys, Welcome to A3-Share File sharing webapp.
This is the Frontend part. I have used html, css, and vanilla js. to build the frontend.
Here, you can upload any file(max 100mb) and you will get a download link.
You can share the download link with your friends to download the file.
You can send email too providing your valid gmail and receiver's valid gmail.
